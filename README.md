The Poll App is a basic web application developed using Django that allows users to vote on different questions. It provides a simple interface where users can view a list of questions (polls), click on a question to see the available choices, and vote for their preferred option. After voting, users can view the results for each poll.

The app uses Djangoâ€™s powerful model-view-template (MVT) architecture. Models are used to define database tables for storing questions and their choices. Views handle the logic for displaying polls, processing votes, and showing results. Templates are used to present the user interface in the browser. The admin panel is also used to easily add or manage polls.

This project helps beginners understand Django fundamentals such as routing, models, views, templates, and the admin interface. It is often one of the first Django projects used in tutorials and learning environments.
